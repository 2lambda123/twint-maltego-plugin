## Requirements

For users:
- Twint;
- Elasticsearch;
- Maltego.

For developers `canari` is required as well.

## Installation

Open Maltego, import `twint.mtz` and play.

## How-to

In these early stages of development (not ready for production mode) this set of transforms will fetch data from a local (localhost:9200) instance of Elasticsearch.

If you want to play with a remote instance of Elasticsearch just edit what you need in `twint/src/transforms/getTweets.py`

Feel free to open a new issue and suggest new features or what you would like to have!
